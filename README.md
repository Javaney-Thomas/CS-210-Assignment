This project was based on a scenario of a software developer working at a company called Chada Tech, where they needed an item-tracking application for a grocery store.
The application is supposed to analyze text records and place them in chronological order throughout the workday. the effect of this was to see the most popular items.
This was then to be used to rearrange their produce section to create the most effective layout for their customers. 

I particularly think I did the menu items, the list items, and the frequency information well.

I found the tracking section most difficult to write but to overcome this I researched other sources and tutorials on lists and loops over YouTube. 
The knowledge gained from those tutorials gave me the confidence I needed to understand the different tools needed for particular tasks.
That distinction is a transferable skill that I think will save me a lot of time in the future on other projects.

To make this program readable and well formatted I ensured to keep a line minimum, utilize whitespace effectively, 
and made simple "dumb-down" comments for me to keep track of everything.
